###Descrition
This task is for practicing bitoperations.
Make a function that has two inputs.
First input should remain untouched.
Second one will be a mask. We have to shift the bits until it becomes an uneven number. Then copy the remaining bits until the number's length will be greater or equal to the first parameter.
This function should return with the first input and the mask OR operation result.
